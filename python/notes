train the NN with rotated books.

Data Augmentation in Keras

resize image to 100x150

==================================================

First run with Theano backend - It guessed 5 books correctly for at least 3 tries
Then tried data augmentation with ImageDataGenerator - Again it gave coorect results

Switced to Tensorflow backend - Got a weird Future Warning
It's accuraccy dropped to 0.2
Started to try the Worksheet pdf file

After following the pdf file, my computer struggles to train the NN.
I started to slow down
